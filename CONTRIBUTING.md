## Bug reports and patches

Please direct patches or bug reports to the [mailing list](https://lists.sr.ht/~mgmarlow/public-inbox).

- Before reporting a bug, try replicating it with `emacs -Q` to ensure it's not a problem specific to your configuration.
- Code changes should follow [Emacs Coding Conventions](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Tips.html) and the [Emacs Lisp Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-lisp-style-guide).
